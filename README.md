# Property Report Readme

## Introduction

Welcome to the Property Report notebook for the "Statistics for AI and Data Science" course, Coursework 3.
This analysis delves into the property data across the nine regions of England,
focusing on the average prices of four property types: flats, detached, semi-detached, and terraced properties.
The exploration spans a period of 36 months, aiming to identify trends and patterns
